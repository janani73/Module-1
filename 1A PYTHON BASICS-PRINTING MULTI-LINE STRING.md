# Experiment No: 1a Boolean Values in Python and Their Numeric Behaviour

## AIM  
To create a Python program to print the string in multiple lines using triple quotes.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.
2.Compare 1 with True and store the result in a.
3.Compare 0 with False and store the result in b.
4.Add True to 5 and store the result in c (True = 1).
5.Add False to 9 and store the result in d (False = 0).
6.Print the values of a, b, c, and d.
7.End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
a = (1 == True)
b = (0==False)
c = True + 5
d = False + 9
print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```

## RESULT
```
The program was executed and verified successfully. It shows that Boolean values behave like integers, where True equals 1 and False equals 0, and the computed outputs are displayed correctly.
