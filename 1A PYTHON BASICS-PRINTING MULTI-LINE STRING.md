# Experiment No: 1a Complex Number Representation and Real-Part Extraction in Python

## AIM  
To create a Python program to print the string in multiple lines using triple quotes.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start
2.Read the first input and store it in variable a (this represents the real part).
3.Read the second input and store it in variable b (this represents the imaginary part).
4.Create a complex number using the values a and b and store it in variable x.
5.Display the complex number x.
6.Extract the real part of the complex number using x.real.
7.Display the real part.
8.End

## PROGRAM
```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
```

## RESULT
```
The program successfully accepts two user inputs, forms a complex number, and displays it. It correctly extracts and prints the real part, demonstrating proper handling of complex data types in Python.
