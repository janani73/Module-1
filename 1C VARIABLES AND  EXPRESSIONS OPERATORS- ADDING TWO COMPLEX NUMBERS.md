# Experiment No: 1c-Arithmetic Expression Evaluation in Python

## AIM
To write a Python program that reads three numbers from the user and evaluates the arithmetic expression a + b * c – a / b, then displays the result.

## ALGORITHM
```
1.Start the program.
2.Read three integer inputs: a, b, and c.
3.Calculate the expression using the formula: a + b * c – a / b.
4.Print the final result.
5.End the program.
```

## PROGRAM
```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
print(a+b*c-a/b)

```

## RESULT
The program successfully reads three numbers from the user, evaluates the arithmetic expression using Python’s operator precedence, and prints the correct computed output.
